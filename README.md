# Face_Recognitionusing-customdataset
This is completly based on deep learning nueral network and implented using Tensorflow framework.
Well this facenet is defined and implementation of facenet paper published in Arxiv (FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering). And also contain the idea of two paper named as "A Discriminative Feature Learning Approach for Deep Face Recognition" and "Deep Face Recognition". 
I am  enhacing the accuracy of face recognition method. Generally, on the internet, we would find everyone or most of the people using either the haarcascade, eigenface models provided by the openCv for face recognition. Even I tried too using OpenCv haarcascade . There are one shortcomes of the approaches:
1.In case of the Opencv haarcascade and the fischerface, the accuracy was not so good (60-70%)
To overcome these shortcomes, Deep Learning along with OpenCV(to detect the faces and recognize face is used) is used. This gives a descent accuracy of 87.5 as well as requires less processing time.
